## Bar Chart Stretch Project

### About

This project consists of a library that allows other developers to generate bar charts on their web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

To call this chart, you need to use the function drawBarChart(data, options, element). Replace the data, options, and element with your own data to create your own bar chart.
