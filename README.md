## Bar Chart Stretch Project

### About

This project consists of a library that allows other developers to generate bar charts on their web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

To call this chart, you need to use the function drawBarChart(data, options, element). Replace the data, options, and element with your own data to create your own bar chart. The index.html file has an example of how index.js will work on a webpage.


### Background

- This project was built as an assignment for the [Lighthouse Labs](https://lighthouselabs.ca/) curriculum.

- This project has also been deployed on GitHub pages.


### Demo

Here is an example of a rendered bar chart on GitHub pages.

- The bar chart could use more features, especially customizable value measurements on the X and Y axes.
- There should be an allowance for an unlimited amout of bars without compromising the layout to fully customize the chart as needed.
